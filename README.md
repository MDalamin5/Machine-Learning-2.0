# Machine-Learning-2.0

Welcome to the **Machine-Learning-2.0** repository! This project is my journey to revisit and master the core concepts, algorithms, and advanced techniques of Machine Learning (ML) from scratch. With a strong foundation built during my 3rd year, this repository will act as a detailed documentation of my restart into ML, focusing on implementation, data preprocessing, feature engineering, and cutting-edge projects.

## Objectives

- Relearn and implement all major Machine Learning algorithms.
- Perform comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Dive deep into advanced ML concepts and projects.
- Build a solid portfolio of ML projects to demonstrate expertise.

## Learning Schedule

I will follow a structured approach, inspired by the **100 Days of Machine Learning** playlist by CampusX, to build a robust understanding of Machine Learning concepts. The repository will evolve as I progress through:
- Conceptual learning
- Coding implementations from scratch
- Applying learned techniques to real-world problems.
